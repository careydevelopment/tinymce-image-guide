# tinymce-image-guide
This repository includes a fully deployable Spring Boot app that demonstrates how to use TinyMCE with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. It also demonstrates how you can upload images within the WYSIWWYG editor.

If you're interested in learning more about how this app works, feel free to check out <a href="https://careydevelopment.us/blog/adding-images-in-a-wysiwyg-editor-with-tinymce-thymeleaf-and-spring-boot" target="_blank">the tutorial.</a>

You can run the Spring Boot app by right-clicking on the TinyMceImageGuide class and selecting Run As... and Java Application.

Here's a sample URL that accesses the app from a browser:
